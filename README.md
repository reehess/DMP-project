# Correlation Between the High School Graduation Rates and the Personal Income Data
This project aims to analyze and visualize data related to educational attainment rates and per capita income across U.S. states from 2012 to 2024. Through this analysis, the goal is to understand the relationship between these indicators, identify regional or temporal patterns, and provide valuable insights into the dynamics between income and education in different states over the analyzed period. Additionally, the project seeks to highlight states that stand out in terms of high or low educational attainment rates and propose potential interpretations for the observed disparities.


# Objectives
- Identify the states with the highest and lowest education rates.
- Examine the correlation between income and education across U.S. states.


# Technologies Used
- Python 3: For data analysis and visualization.
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- Matplotlib: For graphical visualizations.
- GoogleColab: For code execution and interactive data exploration.
- GitHub: For version control and code collaboration.


# Data Structure
The data used in this project is organized in the following files:
- personalIncome.csv: provides annual information on per capita income for each U.S. state from 2012 to 2024. The data is structured by state quarterly.
- educationalRate.csv: which contains annual statistics on the number of citizens with a completed high school education, for each U.S. state between 2012 and 2024.
- personalIncome_aggregated.csv: Output file after aggregating income data by year instead of quarters.


# Column Descriptions
GeoName: Name of the state.
2012, 2013, ..., 2024: Columns containing per capita income and education rate data for the respective years.
